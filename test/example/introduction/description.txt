JSON to Java entity & dto mapping, supporting extensive restructuring requiring annotations only.
Spring uses Jackson to map JSON to Java objects; unfortunately, other than renaming fields, it lacks much power.
This is an alternative that doesn't require writing `unpackNested(Map<String, Object>)` methods the way Jackson requires; it instead relies on simple `@JsonAnnotation("{path}/{name}#{flag1,...flagn}?{condition}")` annotations.

For example, when you need to map a JSON object such as 
```
{
  "x": {
    "y": {
      "z": "xyz"
    }
  }
}
```
to an entity such as 
```
class Ent {
    String z;
}
```
it is as simple as 
```
@JsonAnnotation("x/y/")
```
